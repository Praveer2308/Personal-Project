        <h2>About Athlete Nutrition</h2>
        <p><b>Why is Athlete Nutrition Important?</b></p>
        <p>Athlete nutrition is all about eating the right foods to fuel the body for sports and physical activities. It focuses on providing the right balance of nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals to support energy, muscle repair, and overall health. Proper nutrition helps athletes perform at their best, recover faster, and stay healthy. For athletes, what they eat before, during, and after training or competitions can make a big difference in how they feel and how well they perform.</p>
        <h3><b>1. Macronutrients</b></h3>
        <li>Athletes need to pay attention to <b>macronutrients</b> because they provide the energy and building blocks necessary for performance and recovery. The three main macronutrients are <b>carbohydrates</b><b>Proteins</b> and <b>Fats</b>.</li> 
        <img src="/what-are-macronutrients-s.jpg">
        <br>
        <h4><b>Proteins</b></h4>
        <p>Protein is essential for athletes because it helps build and repair muscles, which are broken down during exercise. It also supports the immune system and helps produce enzymes and hormones needed for various bodily functions. After physical activity, muscles need protein to recover and grow stronger. For athletes, having enough protein is key for recovery and muscle development.</p>
        <img src="https://i.imgflip.com/xmlf7.jpg">
        <ul><b>Sources of Protein</b>
            <li>Meat</li>
            <li>Fish</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Dairy(milk, cheese, yogurt)</li>
            <li>Plant-Based Options(Lentils, Tofu, Cottage Cheese, quinoa, nuts)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4><b>Carbohydrates</b></h4>
        <p>Carbohydrates are the body's main source of energy. When athletes exercise, their bodies use carbohydrates for quick energy. After carbs are consumed, they are stored in the muscles and liver as glycogen, which the body can use during physical activity. For endurance athletes, having enough glycogen is especially important because it helps sustain energy levels throughout long workouts or competitions.</p>
        <ul>Sources of Carbohydrates
            <li>Whole grains (brown rice, oats, whole wheat bread) </li>
            <li>Fruits (bananas, apples, berries) </li>
            <li>Vegetables (Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes, Carrots, etc) </li>
            <li>Legumes (Lentils, Chickpeas, Beans) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Athletes need to eat carbohydrates before and after exercise to keep their energy up and help the muscles recover.</p>
        <br>
        <h4><b>Fats</b></h4>
        <p>Fats are also an important part of an athlete's diet, providing a long-lasting energy source for extended periods of exercise. Unlike carbohydrates, fats are stored in the body for longer-term energy needs. Healthy fats help with inflammation control, support brain function, and aid in nutrient absorption. However, it's important to focus on healthy fats and limit unhealthy fats like trans fats and saturated fats.</p>
        <ul><b>Sources of Healthy Fats</b>
            <li>Avacados</li>
            <li>Nuts and seeds (Almonds, Chia Seeds, Walnuts) </li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Fatty Fish (Salmon, Mackrel, Sardines) </li>
            <li>Nut Butters (Peanut Butter, Almond Butter) </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Balancing Proteins, Carbs and Fats</h3>
        <p>To perform at their best, athletes need the right balance of these macronutrients. Carbohydrates give quick energy for intense activity, protein helps with muscle repair and recovery, and fats provide steady energy for longer workouts. Eating a well-balanced diet with all three macronutrients is essential for keeping the body fueled, recovering properly, and staying healthy.

        <h2>The Role of Nutrition in Athletic Performance</h2>
        <p>All people should care about nutrition, but sports participation places unique demands on the body. This means that nutrition can help (or hinder) athletes in different ways:</p>
        <li><b>Nutrition provides the body with energy.</b> Athletes burn through their energy stores faster than an average person, especially during a competition, so their energy demands are higher. Burning more calories than you consume can not only affect sports performance, but can also lead to health issues such as fatigue and increased risk of stress fractures. When an athlete does not get enough energy from food relative to the amount of energy they are burning, it is called relative energy deficiency in sports (REDs). The key sources of energy in the foods we eat are carbohydrates, fats and proteins, and it’s crucial for athletes to consume these in a balanced way.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Nutrition helps the Body heal.</b> Exercise is meant to cause micro-damage to the muscles by challenging them to handle more weight or resistance, and competition is often more intense than a regular workout. The good news is that muscles rebuild themselves bigger and stronger. It is also important to note that protein is rarely used as an energy source; rather, protein plays a major role in helping the muscles and other tissues recover. However, too much protein can increase the risk of dehydration and calcium loss.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Fluids regulate hydration and body temperature.</b> Fluids are part of nutrition, too! Getting enough water is especially important for athletes, who tend to lose fluids faster than an average person due to increased sweating, especially when padding and extra sport gear are worn in sports like football and lacrosse. Plus, many competitions are outdoors, and hydration is crucial when competing on a hot day.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Nutrition affects body weight.</b> Weight is important in certain sports such as wrestling, where it determines in which group an athlete competes. Many athletes feel pressure to meet specific weight goals. Working with a dietitian can help make sure your health and performance don’t suffer in your efforts to control weight.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Nutrition is important for overall health.</b> When the body has all the nutrients it needs, it means you can function at your best both mentally and physically. Nutrition also helps support your immune system, helping you have fewer sick days.</li>

    <section id="The Bidirectional Link Between Food and the Mind">
        <h2>Nutrition Boosting Game Performance</h2>    
        <li>As humans, our relationship to food is complex. Food can be nourishing, enjoyable, social, and soothing. For this reason, there is a bidirectional relationship between diet and mental health. This means that mood can influence eating habits, and in turn, eating can impact mood and psychological well-being.</li>
        <br>
        <li>When you’re not getting proper nutrition, you might feel very stressed in an otherwise mildly stressful situation. As a result, you may turn to less healthy foods for comfort or as a time saver to mediate the feelings.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Because this food is less healthy, it further reduces your ability to adapt to stress. This can create a vicious cycle of eating foods that can worsen anxious feelings.</li>
        <br>
        <li>A similar cycle can happen with depression. You may feel depressed and low energy, so you turn to soothing foods or those that don’t require any work. These are often high in sugar and low in nutrition. You may feel worse after eating the foods, perpetuating the circle of worsening diet and mental health.</li>
        <br>
        <li>A 2019 study found that when people who have mental health challenges increase their fruit and vegetable intake, it reduces their symptoms</li>
        <br>
        <li>Another study in 2022 looked at the effects of the Mediterranean diet on those with severe depression. In this 12-month randomized, controlled trial, the intervention group (those on the diet) saw a large 20.6-point reduction in depression symptoms on the Beck Depression scale. A 6.2-point reduction was observed in the control group (not on the diet).</li>
        <br>
        <li>The Mediterranean diet is built around a variety of whole foods rich in fiber, vegetables, fruits, legumes, healthy fats, and fish. It includes very minimal, if any, ultra-processed food.</li>
        <br>
        <li>While this diet has gained popularity, many diets around the world apply similar principles of eating a diet filled with a variety of whole foods and very few ultra-processed foods.</li>
